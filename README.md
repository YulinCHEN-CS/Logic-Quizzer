# Logic-Quizzer

Propositional Logic Quizzer is a tool that allows users to deepen their understanding of computational logic. It is catered for computer science students in a mixed international cohort, who often have demanding course loads and limited time to study. The tool provides an engaging and interactive platform that allows students to practice a small number of questions presented in a succinct format which can be completed in a short amount of time, with the aim of helping students to stay motivated and on track with their studies. The background knowledge required is adequate understanding of the 5 basic logical operations as well as conversions of logic equations into an appropriate DNF format. Due to the content largely consisting of symbols and tables which are recognised universally, the questions are accessible for students regardless of any differences in culture or language fluency although it is expected that the english words for operations (e.g. disjunction and conjunction) and definitions (satisfiability and validity) are known beforehand.
